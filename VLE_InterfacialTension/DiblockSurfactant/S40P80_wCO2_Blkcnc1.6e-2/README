1.This code handles Polyol(PPO)+CO_2+Surfactant(PDMS-PPO) ternary mixture.
2.Surfactant is modeled as a diblock-copolymer. 
3.I define total number of bead types as 4 (1 for the polyol, 1for the CO2  and 2 for the surfactant)
4.Code builds on the framework laid out by H.Chao. 
5. **qs_fwd_pgt, **gs_bkd_pgt are the new arrays defined handle forward and backward surfactant propagators.
6. *Xar represents fraction of A type(here PDMS) surfactant segments at any spatial position j
7. Main changes (wrt to H.Chao's original) to the code are in the files find_blkmu.cpp,dfree.cpp, poly_density.cpp
8. Only minor changes are addressed in the calc_press.cpp, calc_diff.cpp 
9. find_blkmu.cpp and dfree.cpp follow very similar format. Mainly the section/function in these codes, which handle 
chain formation energy and releveant derivatives,is restructured significantly. Other sections/functions should be
very similar to original H.Chao's code.
10. In the poly_density.cpp, Polyol and surfactant desnity propagator are handled separately.
Even the corresponding density accumulations are handled separately. 
11. Initialize.cpp has a random number generator module to decide on the position of the branches. 
However that function is not used here. 
12. NPEOBranches in the dft.input is not used at all in this code. There are no PEO branches in this surfactant.
However, read_input.cpp still reads it, but we don't use it anywhere else.
